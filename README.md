## LittleX
**Description:** LittleX Bring iPhone-X features to non-x devices on iOS 11, it also brings PiP and the iPad Dock to all iOS 11 Devices

Compared to original version:
1) Option "Larger Keyboard" disabled - BUGGY AS HELL!!! 
2) HomeBar switched off - looks ugly on 4.7 screen
3) Works inside any app with no bugs (Mainly because of disabled "Larger keyboard" + "HomeBar")
4) No support for iPhone X - Why do you even need that???
5) No settings
